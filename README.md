<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://fortniteassistant.xyz/fnassistantautoshoppage.png)

Project **Fortnite Assistant: Twitter Autoshop** was created to simplify the lives of others :smile:

Here's why:
* You do not need to have your VPS or have a computer turned on for the store to be published after its change,
* Your auto shop automatically changes and publishes to your profile without even having to think about whether it will work. Because it will work.
* You don't need programming knowledge and installing unnecessary scripts on your computer. Just go to the website and configure it. That's it. Yes.

Of course, the store is kept up-to-date and looking good at all times.

### Built With

I know no one asked. But the project was built with Node.js<br>
It's uptime is around 99.99%. If we find a bug, we try to fix it immediately.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

How to create your auto bot? We'll describe it here step-by-step.

### Twitter Application


For the bot to function, you need to create your Twitter Application on [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/apps). It is not difficult, and it is described e.g. here:<br>
https://iag.me/socialmedia/how-to-create-a-twitter-app-in-8-easy-steps/

### Access Type

For the application to function properly, you must select **READ & WRITE access**. The bot needs to publish the store on your profile, so it needs Write access.

### Final configuration

Finally, you need to do the configuration on the bot project page. You can set here:
* Your Twitter application tokens (how to get them is described [in this article](https://iag.me/socialmedia/how-to-create-a-twitter-app-in-8-easy-steps/))
* Store language (If you don't see yours there, [write to us](https://fortniteassistant.xyz/help) and propose it)
* Custom text displayed when publishing the store. You can also put a replacer there for the day, month and year
* Your own CREATOR'S CODE (for free!)

## Design of the store

Now one of the most important things. What does the shop look like?

Lovely, right?<br>
You can **set the creator code** from the bottom on the right **to your own completely for free**.

## Text displayed with the store
You can define it too. You can use *{dayNumber}*, *{monthNumber}* and *{fullYearNumber}* with shop text to replace them with day, month or year numbers when shop is published.
